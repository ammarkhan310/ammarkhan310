# Hi there, I'm Ammar Khan 👋

## Welcome to my GitHub! 

As a Software Engineer, I'm really into making websites that not only look good but also run smoothly and quickly. My work involves a lot with React, Next.js, Python, and Node.js. I enjoy diving into new tech to see how it can make things better, especially when it comes to creating experiences on the web that are all about ease of use, efficiency, and clean design.
